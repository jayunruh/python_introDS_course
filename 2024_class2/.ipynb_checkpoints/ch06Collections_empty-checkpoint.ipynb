    "\n",
    "Python stores variables as specific datatypes, which tells Python what actions it's allowed to do with it. For example, multiplying two integers together works, but multiplying two strings together doesn't really make sense. Unlike some other languages, Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning that you don't need to explicitly declare the data type, Python will infer it for you. You are also sometimes able to change the type, either explicitly or implicitly.  Different `types` of variables have different methods (read: built-in functions) associated with them. We'll see some examples of those in a little bit. \n",
